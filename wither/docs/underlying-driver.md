### underlying driver
If at any point in time you need direct access to the [underlying driver](https://docs.rs/mongodb/latest/mongodb/), it is always available. All of the `Model` interface methods take a handle to the database, which is part of the underlying driver. You can use the [`Model::collection`](https://docs.rs/wither/latest/wither/model/trait.Model.html#method.collection) to directly access the model's collection, while still using the model's configured read concern, write concern and selection criteria. You can also use the various model convenience methods for serialization, such as the [`Model::instance_from_document`](https://docs.rs/wither/latest/wither/model/trait.Model.html#method.instance_from_document) method.
