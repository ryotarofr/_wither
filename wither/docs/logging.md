### logging
This crate uses the [rust standard logging facade](https://docs.rs/log/), and integrating it with any other logging/tracing framework based on the standard logging facade should be seamless. Getting started with with [env_logger](https://docs.rs/env_logger/latest/env_logger/), [tracing](https://docs.rs/tracing/0.1.15/tracing/) or other similar frameworks is usually quite simple.
